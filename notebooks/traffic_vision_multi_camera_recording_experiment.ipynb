    "# Traffic Vision: Multi-Camera Recording System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Develop a Linux system-level service for continuous multi-camera GDOT traffic stream recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Approach\n",
    "- **System Level:** Bash scripts + systemd service for 24/7 operation\n",
    "- **Recording Method:** Streamlink + FFmpeg (Method 3 from validation tests)\n",
    "- **Data Source:** CSV file with camera definitions\n",
    "- **Storage Structure:** `recordings/CAMERA-ID/YYYY-MM-DD/CAMERA-ID_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recording Configuration\n",
    "- **Development/Testing:** 15-second segments (for workflow demo, included in repo)\n",
    "- **Production Deployment:** 15-minute segments, 24/7 continuous on bare metal storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Implementation\n",
    "- **Base Script:** `multi_camera_recorder.sh` (reads CSV, spawns parallel processes)\n",
    "- **Target:** 8 Atlanta midtown cameras simultaneous recording\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "1. Validate CSV data loading and stream accessibility\n",
    "2. Test parallel recording with 2 cameras\n",
    "3. Scale to full 8-camera deployment\n",
    "4. Configure systemd service for continuous operation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** June 8, 2025  \n",
    "**Branch:** `experiment/multi-camera-recording`"
